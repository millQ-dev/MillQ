# MillQ

MillQ is a modern restaurant management platform for Vietnam.

The product consists of two deliberately separated capabilities:

1. **Operational Core** — authoritative POS, inventory, purchasing, recipes, payments, audit
2. **Production Intelligence** — recommendations and analytics built on operational facts (future sellable module)

## Hosting

**Cursor Origin is the source of truth.** GitHub `millQ-dev/MillQ` is a backup mirror only.

- Canonical remote: `https://origin.cursor.com/millqdev/MillQ.git`
- Browse: [cursor.com/codebase](https://cursor.com/codebase)
- Open PRs on Origin; Implementation Agent arms merge-when-ready; independent agent review; ruleset merges for Level A/B
- Do not merge work on GitHub; do not dual-write
- After cutover only the backup identity writes GitHub `main` and release/protected tags

Details: [`docs/processes/origin-github-hosting.md`](docs/processes/origin-github-hosting.md), [`docs/processes/autonomous-development.md`](docs/processes/autonomous-development.md), and [ADR-0004](docs/decisions/ADR-0004-origin-source-of-truth.md).

- [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/) — ADRs

## Status

Foundation Operational Core (Origin merge candidate): Accepted ADR-0001…0003, **ADR-0006**, **ADR-0007**; typed operational facts; CostValue yield math; fact feed guardrail. Full POS and Block C are not started. Block B domain-boundary ADRs remain Proposed on a separate draft (note: Origin hosting ADR-0004 is Accepted and is a different decision).

**CI:** Origin CI not attached yet. Current merge gates are local checks + independent Origin review + Origin ruleset. GitHub Actions workflow may exist as dormant/backup-compatible definition and is **not** a merge gate.
