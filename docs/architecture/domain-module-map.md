# Domain Module Map (Architecture v1.3)

- **Status:** Proposed reference with Architecture v1.3
- **Date:** 2026-09-04
- **Supersedes:** Architecture v1.2 module map naming for extended modules
- **Authority:** [`architecture-v1.3.md`](architecture-v1.3.md), ADR-0008 (Accepted), ADR-0011…0021 (Accepted)
- **Note:** Origin hosting ADR-0004 is unrelated.

Each row is an internal module boundary inside the **modular monolith**.

Legend:

- **Owns** — source of truth; only this module writes these records
- **Produces** — immutable or versioned facts other modules may consume
- **Depends on** — reads/commands other modules; no circular ownership

| **Commands in** | RegisterTenant, CreateOutlet, AssignBrand, PlaceTerminal, SetOutletCapability |
| **Facts out** | OutletConfigured, CapabilityChanged, StructureAssignmentActivated |
| **Depends on** | Jurisdiction (profile refs) |

LegalEntity is fiscal/legal — **not** part of menu inheritance.

        ↓
Catalog, Units & Packaging, Supplier Management
        ↓
Recipes & Costing (derived), Menu Configuration, POS Presentation, Channel Menu
        ↓

        ↓
Reporting

Production Intelligence (projections / EvidenceBuilder → ModelGateway)   [supporting]
Voice & Multilingual Interaction → ModelGateway / SpeechAdapter → commands [supporting]
```

Audit observes all. Integrations and Fiscalization at the edge. Intelligence and Voice **do not** own Core ledgers.
