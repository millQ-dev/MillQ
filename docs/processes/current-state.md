## Proposed (Architecture v1.3 — not yet Accepted)

_None remaining in the ADR-0011…0024 set covered by this architecture track._

### Settlement / non-custody invariant (ADR-0013 + ADR-0016)

A recorded **external** deposit/prepayment may be referenced/allocated later but **must not** become a MillQ custodial balance or wallet.

### Floor / Table ownership invariant (ADR-0017)

Floor/Table owns `TableAssignment` (refs `OrderId`). Orders owns Order truth only and does not depend on Floor/Table internal state.

### Professional access invariant (ADR-0022)

Ordinary membership ≠ professional `ClientAccessGrant`. Mutations in exactly one client Tenant context; no shared tenant / cross-client mutation.

### Employment decision invariant (ADR-0023)

AI may score/recommend; material employment decisions require authorized human action + audit. Assessment audio ≠ ADR-0021 zero-retention.

### Allergen resolution invariant (ADR-0024)

Structured Effective Recipe resolution; `UNKNOWN` never silently SAFE; AI/voice must not invent ingredients.

## Architecture baseline

- [`docs/architecture/architecture-v1.2.md`](../architecture/architecture-v1.2.md) (Accepted)
- [`docs/architecture/architecture-v1.3.md`](../architecture/architecture-v1.3.md)
- [`docs/architecture/domain-module-map.md`](../architecture/domain-module-map.md)
- [`docs/architecture/block-c-implementation.md`](../architecture/block-c-implementation.md)
- [`docs/architecture/block-d1.1-recipes-preparations.md`](../architecture/block-d1.1-recipes-preparations.md)
- [`docs/architecture/block-d1.2a-production-batch.md`](../architecture/block-d1.2a-production-batch.md)

## What exists in code

- Block C: Goods Receipt → movements → balance → CostQuote → GoodsReceived fact mirror
- Block D1.1 **Merged**: RecipeSpecification / RecipeVersion / PreparationSpecification with VIRTUAL|STOCK_TRACKED, nested graph validation, normative yield — **no** ProductionBatch / sale write-off
- Block D1.2A (this PR): ProductionBatch DRAFT→FINALIZED with pinned PreparationVersion, normative vs actual I/O/yield, deviation classification — **no** inventory movements / costing
- No Migration adapters, fiscal providers, POS/FloorPlan, Grab/Shopee, ModelGateway, ASR/TTS, or GPU runtime
- No Professional Account / Workforce recruiting / Allergen Resolver application code

## Explicitly not started (implementation)

- **D1.2B** production inventory posting / balance / costing / reversal mechanics — **not started**
- Next vertical slices after PO: **Sale write-off → Food Cost**
- Migration Core scaffolding & source adapters
- Fiscal provider adapters
- POS / FloorPlan / Grab / Shopee
- ModelGateway / Intelligence runtime / Voice runtime
- Professional Account / accountant workspace
- Workforce recruiting / learning / assessment product
- Allergen Resolver UI
- Intelligence algorithms

## Next recommended sequence

1. ~~Block C~~ done  
2. ~~Architecture v1.3 alignment~~ merged  
3. ~~ADR-0011…0024~~ **Accepted**  
4. ~~Block D1.1 Recipes & Preparations foundation~~ **Merged** (PR #25 → `3ff79a2`)  
5. Block D1.2A ProductionBatch domain foundation — **await handoff review #1 / merge**  
6. Further application slices (incl. **D1.2B**) remain **STOP** until PO launch  
7. Review policy: standard handoff review #1 (full-diff only if ambiguity / scope / CI suspicion)
